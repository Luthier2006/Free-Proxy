This project is a **HTML + FastAPI website** that displays real-time proxy (SOCKS4/5) information obtained from [spys.one](https://spys.one/en/socks-proxy-list/).

The system scrapes the proxy list and automatically updates it every **60 seconds**, displaying:

- ✅ IP and Port
- ✅ Proxy Type (SOCKS4 or SOCKS5)
- ✅ Country / City
- ✅ Hostname / Organization (when available)
- ✅ Latency
- ✅ Speed
- ✅ Uptime
- ✅ Last Check

---

## 📂 Project Structure

🚀 Future Improvements

Add advanced filters (by country, proxy type, minimum speed)

Record history in a database (SQLite/PostgreSQL)

Create a dashboard with latency and uptime graphs
